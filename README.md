# tinySynth
tinySynth emulates the firsts analog synthesizers appeared  during the 70s. 
It is a basic VSTi Synthesizer developed using the JUCE environment. 
I developed tiny Synth as a research work inside my final project for the completion of the course "BA/BSC (HONS) AUDIO PRODUCTION" at SAE Amsterdam
The tinySynth project was inspired by examples and ideas coming from the Internet and in particular the vstSynth of G.Olochwoszcz and the usage of STK libraries.
tinySynth in its simplicity it is fully functional. It is distributed according to open source license. 
I hope it can be used as a virtual instrument but also as an example for people who are starting the journey for the development of such as products.
The instruction.pdf provides more details and the instructions about the projectâ€™s setup and recompiling.
